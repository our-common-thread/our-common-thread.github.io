_Note: I've tested screen-reader accessibility of AstroPaper using **VoiceOver** on Mac and **TalkBack** on Android. I couldn't test all other screen-readers out there. However, accessibility enhancements in AstroPaper should be working fine on others as well._

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of AstroPaper, you'll see the following folders and files:

```bash
/
├── public/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── logo.png
│   └── toggle-theme.js
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── socialIcons.ts
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   │   |  blog/
│   │   |    └── some-blog-posts.md
│   │   └── config.ts
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
│   └── styles/
│   └── utils/
│   └── config.ts
│   └── types.ts
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.

## Google Site Verification (optional)

You can easily add your [Google Site Verification HTML tag](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag) in AstroPaper using environment variable. This step is optional. If you don't add the following env variable, the google-site-verification tag won't appear in the html `<head>` section.

```bash
# in your environment variable file (.env)
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-google-site-verification-value
```
