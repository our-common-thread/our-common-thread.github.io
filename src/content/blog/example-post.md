On my path to achieve the cleanest lines in tapestry crochet history, I dove deep and found some key elements that lend themselves to the cause.

## Stitch Offset

Pixel art does not translate perfectly to crochet colorwork charts, and this becomes the most apparent when working on details where precision is important (e.g. linework, text). Stitches in tapestry crochet more closely resemble a brick wall than a grid. Instead of stacking in perfect columns, they are offset by about half a stitch. This offset can lead to stitches that look correct on a pixelized chart, but come off as a mistake once it's crocheted.

## Stitch Direction

Stitches lean in the direction you are crocheting. If you are crocheting left to right, that row will lean right. Because tapestry crochet alternates working on the right side and wrong side, rows alternate between leaning left and right. Keeping this in mind can help you develop a gut-check while stitching and give you an idea of where you are in the 'brick wall'.
