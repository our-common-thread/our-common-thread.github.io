Welcome! I am Beans, a passionate fiber artist with a special dedication
to crochet. Enjoy this collection of my latest works and creative endeavors.

## Fiber Arts

Fiber art techniques I have experience with:

- Crochet
- Cross Stitch
- Embroidery
- Visible Mending
- Knitting
- Sewing

## Sustainability

Sustainability is also an important part of my practice. When possible, materials and tools are sourced second hand, with some sources including local nonprofits. All materials are lovingly hand washed in preparation for their new life. The fiber / fashion industry is known to create a lot of waste, and I look to reduce this burden wherever possible. 

## Commissions

I will have a booth at CHASM on October 19th, 12-6pm!
