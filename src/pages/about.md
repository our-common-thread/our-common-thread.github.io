Welcome! I am Beans, a passionate fiber artist with a special dedication
to crochet. Enjoy this collection of my latest works and creative endeavors.

## <u>Fiber Arts</u>

Fiber art techniques I have experience with:

- Crochet
- Cross Stitch
- Embroidery
- Visible Mending
- Knitting
- Sewing

## <u>Sustainability</u>

Sustainability is also an important part of my practice. When possible, materials and tools are sourced second hand, with some sources including local nonprofits. All materials are lovingly hand washed in preparation for their new life. Yarn scraps are collected and used with polyfill stuffing for products that need filling. The scraps are prioritized for use in test and personal products. The fiber / fashion industry is known to create a lot of waste, and I look to reduce this burden wherever possible.

## <u>Commissions</u>

I am currently open for select commissions. You can reach me at my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/ourcommonthread" target="_blank">Ko-Fi</a> or send me an email at our.common.thread.art@gmail.com.

## <u>Markets</u>

I will have a booth at CHASM on October 19th, 12-6pm! <br/>

#### Pattern References

Below is a list of patterns sources used to create some of my market items!

- Cat head applique: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/limlenn">@limlenn</a>
- Sprout bookmark (modified): Tae of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tyinganend.com">Tying An End</a>

#### Sustainability

When making items in bulk for markets I prioritize using secondhand materials to help reduce the amount of waste on this planet. The bulk of my yarn comes from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seattlerecreative.org">Seattle ReCreative</a>, "a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting creativity, community and environmental stewardship through creative reuse & art education." The yarn is hand-washed with care so you can be sure of a clean, quality product!
