Welcome! I am Beans, a passionate fiber artist with a special dedication
to crochet. Enjoy this collection of my latest works and creative endeavors.

## <u>Fiber Arts</u>

Fiber art techniques I have experience with:

- Crochet
- Cross Stitch
- Embroidery
- Visible Mending
- Knitting
- Sewing

## <u>Sustainability</u>

Sustainability is also an important part of my practice. When possible, materials and tools are sourced second hand, with some sources including local nonprofits such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seattlerecreative.org">Seattle ReCreative<Icon class="size-3 align-super" name='mdi:external-link' /></a>. All materials are lovingly hand washed in preparation for their new life. Yarn scraps are collected and used with polyfill stuffing for products that need filling. The scraps are prioritized for use in test and personal products. The fiber / fashion industry is known to create a lot of waste, and I look to reduce this burden wherever possible.

## <u>Commissions</u>

I am currently open for select commissions. You can reach me at my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/ourcommonthread" target="_blank">Ko-Fi<Icon class="size-3 align-super" name='mdi:external-link' /></a> or send me an email at our.common.thread.art@gmail.com.
